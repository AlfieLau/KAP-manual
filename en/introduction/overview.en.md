## KAP Overview

Kyligence Analytics Platform（KAP）is an enterprise ready Big Data product built on *Apache Kylin*, which empowers sub-second query latency on massive scale, and simplified Big Data Analytics for business users, analysts and engineers. KAP is carrying out a full range of innovation which business users focus on the field of implementation efficiency, security controllability, performance optimization, self-service agile BI, system monitoring, whlie KAP inherits prominent advantages of high-performance query, easy-to-use modeling, multiprotocol support, non-intrusive architecture and so on.

**New Column Storage Engine**

KAP uses new column storage engine, supports for multi-index, specially optimizes for ultra-high cardinal dimensions, complex filtering conditions. Compared with Apache Kylin, KAP's query performance has increased several times to dozen times and saved over 50%  storage space.

**Raw Data Query**

KAP which is built on its own column-based storage engine, and inverted index and other indexing technologies, breaking the traditional OLAP engine can only query the limitations of aggregated data, comprehensive support for detailed data query, optimize the support for wide table, reduce the difficulty of data modeling, has better service of data exploration and analyses.

**Agile BI**

Kyligence Analyzer which is built in agile BI platform, users can browse multiple data sources interactively by familiar drag-and-drop and support multidimensional analysis methods such as drilling, slicing, rotating, and so on. It supports dozens of visual reporting technologies, simple multi-format data sharing, greatly improving users' efficiency of Big Data Analysis.

**Safe And Controllable**

KAP supports out-of-the-box user management and cell-level access control. Users have access to the depth of integration of certification system to ensure data access manageability, traceability.

**Compatible With The Mainstream Platform**

KAP is compatible with open source Hadoop and mainstream commercial Hadoop distributions. It can run on distributions and platforms such as Apache Hadoop, Hortonworks HDP, Microsoft HDInsight, AWS EMR, and mutual authentication with Cloudera CDH.
