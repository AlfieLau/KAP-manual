# Use Count Distinct in KAP

## Background

Count Distinct is a commonly measure in OLAP analyze, usually used for uv, etc. Apache Kylin offers two kinds of count distinct, approximately and precisely, differs on resource and performance.

## Approximately Count Distinct

Apache Kylin implements approximately count distinct using 
HyperLogLog algorithm, offered serveral precision, with the error rates 
from 9.75% to 1.22%. 
The result of measure has theorically upper limit in size, as 2^N bytes.
 For the max precision N=16, the upper limit is 64KB, and the max error 
rate is 1.22%. 
This implementation’s pros is fast caculating and storage resource saving, but can’t be used for precisely requirements.

## Precisely Count Distinct

Apache Kylin also implements precisely count distinct based on 
bitmap. For the data with type tiny int(byte), small int(short) and int,
 project the value into the bitmap directly. For the data with type 
long, string and others, encode the value as String into a dict, and 
project the dict id into the bitmap.
The result of measure is the serialized data of bitmap, not just the 
count value. This makes sure that the result is always correct with any 
roll-up, even across segments.
This implementation’s pros is precise result, no error, but needs more 
storage resources. One result size might be hundreds of MB, when the 
count distinct value over millions.

## Global Dictionary

Apache Kylin encodes values into dictionay at the segment level by default. That means one value in different segments maybe encoded into different ID, then the result of count distinct will be incorrect.

In v1.5.3 we introduce “Global Dictionary” with ensurance that one value always be encoded into the same ID across different segments. Meanwhile, the capacity of dictionary has expanded dramatically, upper to support 2 billion values in one dictionary. It can also be used to replace the default dictionary which has 5 million values limitation.

Current version (v1.5.3) has no GUI for defining global dictionary yet, you need manually edit the cube desc json like this:

```
"dictionaries": [
    {
          "column": "SUCPAY_USERID",
	 	   "reuse": "USER_ID",
          "builder": "org.apache.kylin.dict.GlobalDictionaryBuilder"
    }
]
```

The `column` means the column which to be encoded, the `builder` specifies the dictionary builder, only `org.apache.kylin.dict.GlobalDictionaryBuilder` is available for now.
The ‘reuse` is used to optimize the dict of more than one columns based 
on one dataset, please refer the next section ‘Example’ for more 
details.

Higher version (v1.5.4 or above) provided GUI for global dictionary definetion, the ‘Advanced Dictionaries’ part in step ‘Advanced Setting’ of cube designer.

The global dictionay cannot be used for dimension encoding for now, that means if one column is used for both dimension and count distinct measure in one cube, its dimension encoding should be others instead of dict.

## Example

Here’s some example data:

| DT         | USER_ID | FLAG1 | FLAG2 | USER_ID_FLAG1 | USER_ID_FLAG2 |
| ---------- | ------- | ----- | ----- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 2016-06-08 | AAA     | 1     | 1     | AAA           | AAA           |
| 2016-06-08 | BBB     | 1     | 1     | BBB           | BBB           |
| 2016-06-08 | CCC     | 0     | 1     | NULL          | CCC           |
| 2016-06-09 | AAA     | 0     | 1     | NULL          | AAA           |
| 2016-06-09 | CCC     | 1     | 0     | CCC           | NULL          |
| 2016-06-10 | BBB     | 0     | 1     | NULL          | BBB           |

There’s basic columns `DT`, `USER_ID`, `FLAG1`, `FLAG2`, and condition columns `USER_ID_FLAG1=if(FLAG1=1,USER_ID,null)`, `USER_ID_FLAG2=if(FLAG2=1,USER_ID,null)`. Supposed the cube is builded by day, has 3 segments.

Without the global dictionay, the precisely count distinct in a semgent is correct, but the roll-up acrros segments will be wrong. Here’s an example:

```
select count(distinct user_id_flag1) from table where dt in ('2016-06-08', '2016-06-09')

```

The result is 2 but not 3. The reason is that the dict in 2016-06-08 
segment is AAA=>1, BBB=>1, and the dict in 2016-06-09 segment is 
CCC=> 1.
With global dictionary config as below, the dict became as AAA=>1, BBB=>2, CCC=>3, that will procude correct result.

```
"dictionaries": [ { "column": "USER_ID_FLAG1", "builder": "org.apache.kylin.dict.GlobalDictionaryBuilder" } ]
```

Actually, the data of USER_ID_FLAG1 and USER_ID_FLAG2 both are a 
subset of USER_ID dataset, that made the dictionary re-using possible. 
Just encode the USER_ID dataset, and config USER_ID_FLAG1 and 
USER_ID_FLAG2 resue USER_ID dict:

```
"dictionaries": [ { "column": "USER_ID", "builder": "org.apache.kylin.dict.GlobalDictionaryBuilder" }, { "column": "USER_ID_FLAG1", "reuse": "USER_ID", "builder": "org.apache.kylin.dict.GlobalDictionaryBuilder" }, { "column": "USER_ID_FLAG2", "reuse": "USER_ID", "builder": "org.apache.kylin.dict.GlobalDictionaryBuilder" } ]
```



## Performance Tunning

When using global dictionary and the dictionary is large, the step 
‘Build Base Cuboid Data’ may took long time. That mainly caused by the 
dictionary cache loading and eviction cost, since the dictionary size is
 bigger than mapper memory size. To solve this problem, overwrite the 
cube configuration as following, adjust the mapper size to 8GB:
`kylin.job.mr.config.override.mapred.map.child.java.opts=-Xmx8g`
`kylin.job.mr.config.override.mapreduce.map.memory.mb=8500`


## Conclusions

Here’s some basically pricipal to decide which kind of count distinct will be used:
 \- If the result with error rate is acceptable, approximately way is always an better way
 \- If you need precise result, the only way is precisely count distinct
 \- If you don’t need roll-up across segments (like non-partitioned 
cube), or the column data type is tinyint/smallint/int, or the values 
count is less than 5M, just use default dictionary; otherwise the global
 dictionary should be configured, and also consider the “reuse” column
