## KyBot Introduction

With Apache Kylin's further application, Kylin clusters have been expanding, data storage has been increasing and users access Kylin more frequently,  the Kylin user group would have more common and urgent demand such as how to get deeper understanding and more analysis of Kylin cluster and the underlying storage, construction tasks; how to maximize the utilization of Hadoop's resources and optimize query performance; how to improve operational efficiency and ensure the stability of application.

As a poineering company behind Apache Kylin, Shanghai Kui Chi Information Technology Co.Ltd(Kyligence) launched KyBot cloud services, providing online diagnosis, optimization and service for Apache Kylin and its commercial version(KAP). KyBot could provide visual dashboard, system optimization, trouble shooting, technical support and other services by analyzing Kylin log and its related information. 

* **Dashboard：** Show the related content of Kylin system in the form of visualization, including Cube, user access, query delay, statistics and storage of job building, and other aspect information. Provide insight from different dimensions for Kylin cluster and applications. 
* **System Optimization：** Kylin provides the sub-second interactive analysis on the trillion scale of data set, so the optimization of query is the core of Kylin application. KyBot can analyze the corresponding log to offer users intuitive performance analysis, show the performance consumption of each stage through visualization, so as to help users locate bottlenecks quickly and so forth. Meanwhile,  through the analyzing of Cube log, KyBot help users to optimize the data model and Cube's design and storage, in order to find the best balance between storage, construction and query performance.    
* **Troubleshooting：** For distributed system, exceptions and even running errors occur inevitably in the operation processes. How to locate and troubleshoot these problems quickly is the most importance in system operation. By parsing exception, KyBot can monitor fault information rapidly to provide diagnosis capability for users.  
* **Technical Support：** Enterprise users are offered to submit corresponding support requests via a ticket. Combined with the relevant log submitted and analysis results, Kyligence support engineers would locate quickly and provide solutions, reducing the communication cost and improving service response capability.
